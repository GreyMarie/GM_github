Background of my problem:Postoperative delirium occurs as early as 5-7 days after surgery, which occurs when anesthesia is used. Postoperative delirium can lead to cognitive impairment, significantly increase the length of treatment and hospital stay, worsen the prognosis of surgical intervention, and increase its mortality. Although the pathophysiology of POD is unclear, its main mechanism is thought to be ischemic injury caused by impaired neuroendocrine regulation, neuroinflammation, abnormal neural network connectivity, and decreased cerebral blood flow. General anesthesia increases the risk of postoperative cognitive impairment, especially in older and vulnerable populations. Recent animal studies on the effects of anesthesia on postoperative cognitive impairment have provided some valuable insights, but much remains to be understood. Using mice of different ages and conditions, we found that propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia resulted in significant deficits in spatial learning and memory.

Please learn the mechanism of action and possible therapeutic targets of postoperative delirium based on the above information, and then I will ask you some questions.

Cheon et al. (2021) - Scopolamine promotes neuroinflammation and delirium-like neuropsychiatric symptoms in mice via the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome

The study aimed to investigate the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of scopolamine-induced neuroinflammation and delirium-like symptoms in mice. The authors used male C57BL/6J mice and administered scopolamine or vehicle via intraperitoneal injection. They performed behavioral tests and measured levels of cytokines and inflammasome components in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

Materials and Methods:

- Male C57BL/6J mice
- Scopolamine or vehicle injection
- Open field and novel object recognition tests
- ELISA for cytokine detection
- Western blot for inflammasome component detection

Indicators detected:

- IL-1β and IL-18 levels in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex
- NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 protein expression in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex

The authors detected these indicators because previous studies have suggested a link between inflammasome activation and neuroinflammation, which can lead to delirium-like symptoms. The study found that scopolamine administration induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and delirium-like behavior in mice.
